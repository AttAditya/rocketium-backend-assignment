# Rocketium Backend Assignment

### Objective

This task assesses your fundamental skills in Node.js, and working with APIs. It will also help us understand your approach to coding, problem-solving, and handling data.

### Instructions

#### Project Setup

1. Set up a new project using Node.js.
2. Use a suitable project structure to keep your code organized.

#### Data Integration

1. Fetch the dummy JSON data from the following URL: [Dummy JSON Data](https://microsoftedge.github.io/Demos/json-dummy-data/256KB.json)
2. Store this data on the Node.js server.

#### Backend Implementation

1. Set up a Node.js server using Express (or any other preferred framework).
2. Create an API endpoint that serves the dummy JSON data.
3. Write an initialization script that imports the dummy data the first time the project is initialized.
4. Implement functionality to allow basic filtering and sorting of the data on the read request

#### Submission

1. Host your project on a platform like GitHub.
2. Provide a README file with instructions on how to run your project locally.
3. Share the GitHub repository link
4. Share the REST API documentation in a tool like Postman

### Evaluation Criteria

- Code Quality: Clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.
- Project Structure: Logical and organized project structure.
- Functionality: Correct implementation of data fetching, display, and filtering.
- Error Handling: Proper handling of errors and edge cases.
- Documentation: Clear instructions on how to set up and run the project.
